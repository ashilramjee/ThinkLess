# ThinkLess

This Swift App was created on Xcode. The idea for the app is to "Think Less" when performing simple tasks.
 
## Current functionality

Keyboard lock - we all know its a pain to clean your keyboard while your laptop is on. The toggle locks and unlocks the keyboard using Apples
accessibility framework.

*Please note - the app requires accessabilly access in order to work.
